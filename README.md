JavaScript Project: Star Wars Character Viewer
This project is a Star Wars Character Viewer built using plain JavaScript and mock data. It displays a list of Star Wars characters, rendering their names, details, and associated homeworlds. Users can filter characters based on their homeworld, enabling easy navigation through the dataset.

The project emphasizes JavaScript DOM manipulation, dynamic filtering logic, and efficient handling of mock data to create an interactive and engaging experience for Star Wars fans. It showcases clean and modular code design, perfect for understanding JavaScript's potential in small-scale projects
